# About this project

I created this application as the final project of my REACT course.
For building it I used React Router, Refs, Context and other different Hooks.

The main aim of this application is to make a search of GitHub user which I have
<br>to fetch date from GitHub API and display avatar and username. When you click <br>
on username it will take you to the person profile on GitHub
