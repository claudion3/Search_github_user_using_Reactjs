#About this project

I created this application as the final project of my REACT course.
For building it I used React Router, Refs, Context and other different Hooks.

The main aim of this application is to make a search of Github user which I have 
<br>to fetch date from Github API and desplay avatar and username. When you click <br>
on username it will take you to the person profile on Github
